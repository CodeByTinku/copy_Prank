# 🚫 Hack Copy-Paste
This project is a cheeky little HTML page that playfully discourages users from copying its content. If someone tries to copy anything from the page, they'll get a surprise in their clipboard instead of the expected text. 😏

## 💡 What It Does
When a user attempts to copy content from the page (`Ctrl+C` or right-click → Copy), the script intercepts the event and replaces the clipboard content with a custom message — in this case, a middle finger emoji (`🖕`).

## 🔐 Why?
Just for fun — or maybe to lightly troll those who try to steal your content. It's a simple demonstration of how JavaScript can manipulate clipboard behavior.

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file with embedded JavaScript that handles the copy event.

## 🧪 How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Try to copy the text on the page.
4. Paste it somewhere — and enjoy the surprise!

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is meant for educational or humorous purposes. Don't use this technique on serious or user-facing websites — it can frustrate users and isn't a security measure.
